## Description
For this application, we were tasked with building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to other's thoughts, and create a friend list. 

This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation
Install dependencies using ``` npm i ``` and check to make sure Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose are installed. Next, navigate to the terminal and run the command ``` node utils/seed ``` to seed the database, followed by ``` node index.js ``` to start the server.

## Testing
No tests written for this project!
